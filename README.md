# Students_Table
Application develop for show my knowledges in Node.js and React.js. App developed with React to create a SPA(Single Page Application) environment and Styled Components to use JavaScript together with CSS. Also to have a more organized code I used Typescript in both environments (APP and API) added typing in JS. For the development of the API, I used Node.JS with express to develop the environment with all the routes, controllers, models, helpers and config. To store the data, I uploaded a cluster with MongoDB to the cloud, which is a noSQL database. I deployed the api on Heroku and the app on Vercel.
